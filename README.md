> Files to quickly add a Vagrantfile and some Chef cookbooks to basic projects

This is a beginner-level stash for the [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) files I started to copy from project to project. 

:warning: This stuff likely will turn out to be profoundly na√Øve in many embarrassing ways. Still it seems to be good enough too get some usable default Vagrant up. Improvements welcome!

## Intro

Use [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) to run your project on a Virtual Machine to test for platform specific issues while you work in your editors on another platform. 

Vagrant will configure [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to map and link the project root from the host to the guest (on Linux as `/vagrant`) and will automatically synchronise all changes. This means you can use your favorite IDE's and tooling on a Windows or Mac workstation (the VM 'host') and run a VM with a headless Linux server (the VM 'guest') using exactly the same files. 

This is convenient and useful for developing and testing both true server projects and any other (web) projects using Node.js for tooling. (eg: Grunt, Yeoman, Bower, Component.io, Jake, Mocha, etc). 

Vagrant VMs run without GUI, just like a webserver or a CI like [Travis](http://www.travis-ci.org/). Windows support isn't quite ready [vagrant-windows project](https://github.com/WinRb/vagrant-windows).

To provision the default box with Node.js, Grunt etc and run other setup code we use both custom and community [Chef](http://community.opscode.com/) cookbooks, with some bash and shell script. 

Chef and Vagrant use Ruby to configure things, but it is easy to learn: see the [Ruby 101](http://docs.opscode.com/just_enough_ruby_for_chef.html).

## Usage

The sub-directories hold sets of files you can export to your project to quickly get a basic Vagrant managed VirtualBox setup.

### One-time installation

1. Have plenty disk-space free: Virtual Machines can be a couple of GB's per type.
1. Get and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) for your host platform. It conveniently auto-installs [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Chef](http://community.opscode.com/). For more information see the [Vagrant documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html). 
1. Clone this repo somewhere so you can export the files.

### Add Vagrant to a project

1. Use the listing below to choose a set. 
1. In the checkout update your Git submodules to get the various cookbooks (branches from the same repo).
1. From the checkout copy all the *contents* of one set folder to your project. 
	* Make sure the `Vagrantfile` is in the root of the project, it works as the run configuration. 
	* The `cookbooks`-folder from the git submodule holds the [Chef](http://community.opscode.com/) cookbooks and some additional files and should also be in the root.
1. You'll probably want to add the files to your version control.
	* Either copy the files or add a git submodule, see the [.gitmodules](https://github.com/Bartvds/vagrant-start-lazy/blob/master/.gitmodules) for an example.
	* Add the `/.vagrant` directory to your ignore config (eg: `.gitignore`) as it holds local data.

### Use your VM

1. Navigate a console to the project root (where the Vagrantfile is).
1. Run `vagrant up` to start your Virtual Machine. 
	* The first time this will take a while as Vagrant will download the VM box image. It caches this globally for all projects using the same box source id/url.
1. Run `vagrant ssh` to login to the VM guest over SSH. (window users check below to fix this)
1. Use your SSH access to do work and start things on the VM.
	* Vagrant configures the VM to map and link the project root from the host to the guest, and will synchronise all changes.
	* On a Linux guest run `cd /vagrant` to navigate to the linked project folder.
1. When done leave the SSH session and return to the VM host
	* On Linux run `exit`
1. Run `vagrant halt` to stop and close the VM to free resources (do not forget this!)

If you are on Windows and your don't yet have a global `ssh` cli command you can use [this stackoverflow page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9885108/ssh-to-vagrant-box-in-windows) to make `vagrant ssh` work. I use [this solution](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16247703/1026362) with the excellent [ConEmu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/) console wrapper to add git binaries to the windows PATH and get a SSH client. Alternately use Git Bash or a separate Putty session.

### Modifiy provisioning

On every checkout a developer gets a clean VM so any changes outside the shared project folder that must be present for every developer of your project need to be made by the provisioning system:

* The `Vagrantfile` is the main place to edit configs.
* Each set's specifics are bundled in a custom `main` cookbook. Edit this for extra provisioning jobs or run some extra shell script.
* The other cookbooks are imported from the wider Chef community and are *usually* not edited.

## Sets

Currently there is only one documented set:

### grunt

For any project that builds or runs things via [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com). 

Vagrantfile in the [grunt folder](https://github.com/Bartvds/vagrant-start-lazy/tree/master/grunt) and cookbooks in the [grunt branch](https://github.com/Bartvds/vagrant-start-lazy/tree/grunt) (usable as git submodule).

Provisions node.js, setup `grunt` global and runs `npm install` on the project.

* box
	* `precise32` (Ubuntu 12.04)
* npm -g: `grunt-cli`
* export `~/bin/` to PATH 
	* `lz` shell commands (see below).

## Shell commands

### lz &lt;command&gt;

Run some lazy utils:

`lz modules` will clear the `/vagrant/node_modules` and run a clean `npm install`.
